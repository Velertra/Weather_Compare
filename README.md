# WeatherAPI

-App displays data from an api regarding the weather
-has a button the switches between to different points of the api
-Css animation was added

-using Javascript, CSS, HTML and Webpack to hold her all together 


- Need to Orginize code into thier own modules
- Make sure innerHTML is being turned into a string. saw some questionable code in that area (after the class is all questionable but line 104 in api.js). 
- Fix size response
- re-style
- F/C button isnt working.
- 
-API stopped working. believe its because im not using vercel so the api needs to be switched to "http" but the consoles saying thats a no go.
