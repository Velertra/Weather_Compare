# Weather_Compare


-Need to Orginize code into thier own modules
-edit search bar so it only takes correct info and only lets "enter" work after a value has been filled
-add little images
-CSS
-remove colored Divs
-background image 


__Original Idea__
Will have both future forcast, and previous forcast, along with the actual temp that occurred.
-might be unable to do because the future forecast changes every 5 seconds
